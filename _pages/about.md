As an applied microeconomist, most of my research focuses on the Health and Labor Economics. For example, I have analzyed the how cancer diagnoses affect the employment of patients' spouses, how single mothers' labor supply is impacted by the Affordable Care Act, and whether a higher minimum wage leads to a healthier diet. I am currently a Researcher at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org), where most of my work is on evaluation of health policies and programs. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu) and at [Queen’s University](https://www.queensu.ca). I am also a Research Fellow at [RWI–Leibniz Institute for Economic Research](http://en.rwi-essen.de) and an Affiliate at the [Hamburg Center for Health Economics](https://www.hche.uni-hamburg.de). I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de) and my PhD from [Yale University](https://economics.yale.edu).
