I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Economics](http://www.terry.uga.edu/academics/offices/economics/) at the [Terry College of Business](http://www.terry.uga.edu) at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). I am also a Research Fellow at [RWIâ€“Leibniz Institute for Economic Research](http://en.rwi-essen.de) and an Affiliate at the [Hamburg Center for Health Economics](https://www.hche.uni-hamburg.de). I obtained my undergrad degree from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de) and my PhD from [Yale University](https://economics.yale.edu).

My research is in health and labor economics and applied microeconomics more broadly. I am currently working on projects about long-term care, the economic consequences of cancer, and the opioid epidemic.
